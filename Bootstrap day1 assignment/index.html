                    Bootstrap’s grid includes five tiers of predefined classes for building complex responsive layouts.
                     Customize the size of your columns on extra small, small, medium, large, or extra large devices however you see fit.

                <div class="block col-2">
                    Don’t want your columns to simply stack in some grid tiers? Use a combination of different classes for each tier as needed. 
                    See the example below for a better idea of how it all works.

                    Since Bootstrap is developed to be mobile first, we use a handful of media queries to create sensible breakpoints for our layouts and interfaces.
                     These breakpoints are mostly based on minimum viewport widths and allow us to scale up elements as the viewport changes.

                    To handle overlapping borders within components (e.g., buttons and inputs in input groups),
                     we use low single digit z-index values of 1, 2, and 3 for default, hover, and active states.
                     On hover/focus/active, we bring a particular element to the forefront with a higher z-index value to show their border over the sibling elements.
